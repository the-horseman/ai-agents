================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly! I'll analyze the events and IOCs provided using the available tools. Then, I'll write a detailed report in markdown format for a SOC analyst.

First, let's gather information about the IOCs using the provided tools.

Now that we have gathered the available information, let's create a detailed report for the SOC analyst.

# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious PowerShell Activity

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. A PowerShell process (PID: 6140) was created on 2024-08-26 at 12:41:31 UTC.
2. The process loaded various system DLLs and performed API calls related to cryptography and token privileges.
3. Temporary files were created and deleted in the user's AppData folder.
4. Registry modifications were made to the Image File Execution Options for both HKCU and HKLM.
5. DNS queries and network connections were made to proxy.ess.gslb.entsec.com and us-lvs-essmwg1.corp.entsec.com.
6. The PowerShell process created a child process "whoami.exe" (PID: 4928).
7. The PowerShell process accessed the LSASS process, which is a critical Windows component responsible for authentication.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The main problem process is PowerShell (PID: 6140, SHA256: 9785001B0DCF755EDDB8AF294A373C0B87B2498660F724E76C4D53F9C217C7A3). This process is suspicious for several reasons:

1. It made modifications to the Image File Execution Options registry keys, which could be used for persistence or to interfere with other processes.
2. It accessed the LSASS process, which is often targeted for credential dumping.
3. It created and executed a potentially malicious script (AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1).
4. It performed various API calls related to cryptography and token privileges, which could indicate attempts to manipulate system security.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. PowerShell.exe (PID: 6140)
   - Path: C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
   - SHA256: 9785001B0DCF755EDDB8AF294A373C0B87B2498660F724E76C4D53F9C217C7A3
   - Reason: Registry modifications, LSASS access, suspicious script execution

2. whoami.exe (PID: 4928)
   - Path: C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe
   - SHA256: 1D4902A04D99E8CCBFE7085E63155955FEE397449D386453F6C452AE407B8743
   - Reason: Created by the suspicious PowerShell process, potentially used for reconnaissance

## 4. Key Points

1. The PowerShell process executed a script named "AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1" from the user's Desktop (C:\Users\cdaauto\Desktop\threatfiles\threatfiles\AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1).
2. Registry modifications were made to Image File Execution Options, which could be used for persistence or to interfere with other processes.
3. The PowerShell process accessed the LSASS process, which is a common technique used for credential dumping.
4. Network connections were established to potentially suspicious domains.
5. The PowerShell process created a child process "whoami.exe", which could be used for system reconnaissance.

## 5. Insights

Based on the tool responses:

1. The PowerShell executable (SHA256: 9785001B0DCF755EDDB8AF294A373C0B87B2498660F724E76C4D53F9C217C7A3) is classified as "Known trusted" with the classification name "mdas". This suggests that the PowerShell executable itself is not malicious, but it may have been used to execute malicious commands or scripts.

2. No additional information was available for the other file hashes or IP addresses queried. This could be due to the tools timing out or the indicators not being present in the threat intelligence database.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: 479W1022H264
- OS: Windows 10 (Build 19041)
- IP Address: 10.26.23.233
- MAC Address: 00:50:56:a4:1d:84
- User: cdaauto

In conclusion, this event appears to be a potentially serious threat. The PowerShell process exhibited behavior consistent with credential dumping, persistence mechanisms, and possible lateral movement attempts. Further investigation is required to determine the full extent of the compromise and any potential data exfiltration.
