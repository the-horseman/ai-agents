# SOC Analyst Report: Follow-up on Suspicious Activity

## Questions and Answers

1. What specific PowerShell commands were executed by the suspicious processes?

Unfortunately, we don't have specific information about the PowerShell commands executed. The historical data doesn't provide details on the command-line arguments or scripts run by the PowerShell processes. This is a significant gap in our analysis and warrants further investigation.

2. Are there any network connections made by the suspicious svchost.exe or PowerShell processes?

Yes, there are network connections associated with svchost.exe processes, but it's important to note that these may not be directly related to our suspicious svchost.exe file. The connections observed are:

- Outbound TCP connections to IP 10.0.244.93 and 10.0.138.191 on port 3128
- The destination hostnames are squid-proxy-nlb-926ae896ade13fa4.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com and proxy.saas-op1.local
- These connections appear to be going through a proxy server

3. What is the reputation and prevalence of the suspicious svchost.exe file (SHA256: EAA94C9E35D2EE3C003A4F636D5B67DF9644BB97D54325CD43E93FE10CB95146)?

We don't have specific reputation data for this file from the provided information. However, we know it was classified as "malware.binary.exe;fe_ml_heuristic" in the original report.

4. Were there any registry modifications made by the suspicious processes?

Yes, there were registry modifications associated with svchost.exe processes, but again, these may not be directly related to our suspicious file. The main registry activity observed was:

- Creation of keys under HKCU\SOFTWARE\CLASSES\LOCAL SETTINGS\MUICACHE
- This activity is not inherently malicious and is often associated with normal Windows operations

5. Are there any other instances of this suspicious svchost.exe file on other machines in the network?

Based on the data provided, we don't have information about other instances of this specific svchost.exe file on other machines. The network connections and registry modifications we see are from various devices (EC2AMAZ-HD7RBTO, EC2AMAZ-U82M660, EC2AMAZ-S33SM2K, EC2AMAZ-LIQNCQI), but we can't confirm if they're related to our specific suspicious file.

## Analysis and Recommendations

1. Limited PowerShell Insight: We lack specific information about the PowerShell commands executed. This is a critical gap in our analysis. Recommendation: Implement enhanced logging for PowerShell activities, including script block logging and transcription.

2. Network Activity: The observed network connections are to proxy servers, which is not inherently malicious but could be used to mask malicious traffic. Recommendation: Investigate the nature of these proxy connections and verify if they are expected behavior for your environment.

3. File Reputation: While we don't have additional reputation data, the original classification as malware is concerning. Recommendation: Submit the file for further analysis to antivirus vendors or a sandboxed environment for deeper inspection.

4. Registry Activity: The observed registry modifications appear to be routine Windows operations. However, malware can sometimes hide its activities among normal operations. Recommendation: Conduct a more detailed analysis of registry changes, focusing on any unusual or unexpected modifications.

5. Lateral Movement: We don't have clear evidence of this specific file on other machines, but the data shows activity across multiple EC2 instances. Recommendation: Conduct a thorough sweep of all systems for the presence of this file or similar suspicious svchost.exe files outside of their expected locations.

6. Enhanced Monitoring: Given the gaps in our current data, we need better visibility into system activities. Recommendation: Implement or enhance endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to capture more detailed process, file, and network activities.

7. Incident Response: Treat this as a potential security incident. Recommendation: Isolate affected systems, conduct a full malware scan, and consider engaging a incident response team for a more thorough investigation.

8. User Interview: Since the suspicious file was found in a user's Documents folder, it's crucial to understand how it got there. Recommendation: Interview the user "mcafee" about any unusual activities or files they may have interacted with.

In conclusion, while we have some additional context, there are still significant unknowns about this potential threat. The presence of a file classified as malware, combined with suspicious process creation and the involvement of PowerShell, warrants a full security incident investigation. Focus on enhancing logging and monitoring capabilities to better track and analyze such threats in the future.

</answer>Certainly, I'll use the available tools to investigate the current network connections established by the suspicious svchost.exe process. Let's start by using the get_current_network_data tool to gather this information.

<answer>

{"What are the current network connections established by the suspicious svchost.exe process?": "Unfortunately, I am unable to provide information about the current network connections established by the suspicious svchost.exe process. The device DESKTOP-2HS9OV4 is currently offline, and therefore no real-time data could be retrieved. This limitation applies to all real-time queries at the moment, so we cannot use any real-time leads for our investigation.

Given this constraint, we must rely on the historical data we have already gathered. From our previous analysis, we know that svchost.exe processes were observed making outbound TCP connections to proxy servers (10.0.244.93 and 10.0.138.191 on port 3128), with destination hostnames squid-proxy-nlb-926ae896ade13fa4.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com and proxy.saas-op1.local. However, it's important to note that these connections may not be directly related to our specific suspicious svchost.exe file.

To progress with the investigation, we would need to:

1. Wait for the device to come back online to gather real-time data.
2. Analyze offline artifacts such as network logs, if available.
3. Consider other investigative methods that don't rely on real-time data from the device.

It's crucial to note that the inability to gather real-time data significantly hampers our ability to assess the current threat level and activities of the suspicious process."}

</answer>Certainly, I'll use the available tools to investigate if there are any logs or artifacts that can provide information about the PowerShell commands executed by the suspicious processes. Let's start by using the get_historical_process_data tool to gather this information.

<answer>

{"Are there any logs or artifacts that can provide information about the PowerShell commands executed by the suspicious processes?": "Unfortunately, I was unable to find any specific logs or artifacts that provide information about the PowerShell commands executed by the suspicious processes. When querying the historical process data for PowerShell processes spawned by svchost.exe, the result was empty.

This lack of data could be due to several reasons:

1. Limited logging: The system might not be configured to log detailed PowerShell command execution.
2. Log retention: If logs existed, they might have been rotated out or deleted due to retention policies.
3. Anti-forensics: If the activity was malicious, the attacker might have taken steps to clear logs or avoid logging.
4. Query limitations: Our query might not have captured the relevant time frame or might need refinement.

Despite the lack of specific PowerShell command data, we know from the original report that two PowerShell processes were created:

1. powershell.exe (PID: 17616) created at 15:57:24 UTC
2. powershell.exe (PID: 18988) created at 15:57:29 UTC

Both were spawned by the child svchost.exe process (PID: 16964).

To gather more information about the PowerShell commands, we would need to:

1. Check for PowerShell transcription logs, if enabled.
2. Examine the PowerShell event logs (Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational).
3. Look for any script files left behind in temp directories or user profiles.
4. Analyze memory dumps of the PowerShell processes, if available.
5. Review any EDR or SIEM logs that might have captured command-line arguments.

The lack of detailed PowerShell execution logs is a significant gap in our analysis and highlights the need for more comprehensive logging and monitoring, especially for critical processes like PowerShell."}

</answer>Use the tools given to you and try to answer the leads that are shared to you. the leads are - Are there any other instances of this suspicious svchost.exe file on other machines in the network?Certainly, I'll use the available tools to investigate if there are any other instances of the suspicious svchost.exe file on other machines in the network. Let's use the get_historical_file_data tool to search for this file across the network.Certainly, I'll investigate for any indicators of lateral movement or attempts to spread to other machines from the infected host. To do this, we'll need to look at network connections, process creations, and any suspicious file activities across multiple machines. Let's start by examining the historical network data for any unusual connections that might indicate lateral movement.

Now, let's analyze this data to look for indicators of lateral movement or attempts to spread to other machines.

<answer>

{"Are there any indicators of lateral movement or attempts to spread to other machines from the infected host?": "Based on the historical network data provided, there are no clear indicators of lateral movement or attempts to spread to other machines from the infected host. However, there are some observations that warrant further investigation:

1. Multiple machines involved: The network connections are originating from several different EC2 instances (EC2AMAZ-HD7RBTO, EC2AMAZ-U82M660, EC2AMAZ-LIQNCQI, EC2AMAZ-S33SM2K). This could be normal behavior for a distributed system, but it could also indicate that multiple machines are compromised.

2. Consistent outbound connections: All observed connections are outbound to the same destination IPs (10.0.244.93 and 10.0.138.191) and port (3128). These appear to be proxy servers (squid-proxy-nlb-926ae896ade13fa4.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com and proxy.saas-op1.local).

3. Timing of connections: The connections occur at regular intervals across different machines, which could be indicative of scheduled tasks or automated processes.

4. Use of proxy servers: All connections are going through proxy servers, which could potentially mask the true destination of the traffic. This could be used to hide command and control (C2) communications or data exfiltration.

5. Consistent process: Most of the connections are initiated by processes with the same SHA256 hash (2B105FB153B1BCD619B95028612B3A93C60B953EEF6837D3BB0099E4207AAF6B), which is different from our suspicious svchost.exe file.

While these observations don't definitively prove lateral movement or attempts to spread, they do raise some concerns:

1. The involvement of multiple machines could indicate that the threat has already spread beyond the initially identified infected host.
2. The consistent use of proxy servers could be an attempt to hide malicious network activity.
3. The regular timing of connections could indicate automated malicious activity.

To further investigate potential lateral movement:

1. Analyze the svchost.exe processes on all involved machines to see if they match the suspicious hash we initially identified.
2. Investigate what lies beyond the proxy servers - where is the traffic ultimately going?
3. Check for any unusual authentication attempts or remote access between these machines.
4. Look for any newly created scheduled tasks or services on these machines that could be responsible for the regular network connections.
5. Examine any shared resources or network drives that could have been used to spread malware between these machines.

In conclusion, while we don't see clear evidence of lateral movement, the involvement of multiple machines and the consistent pattern of outbound connections through proxy servers are concerning. Further investigation is needed to determine if this is normal network behavior for your environment or if it represents a widespread compromise."}
