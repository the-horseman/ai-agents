================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly, I'll analyze the events and IOCs provided, using the available tools to gather more information. Then I'll write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

Let's start by querying the IOCs and file hashes we have:

Now that we have gathered additional information about the IOCs, let's create a detailed report for the SOC analyst.

# SOC Analyst Report: Potential Malware Execution and Suspicious Activity

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. On 2024-10-16 at 14:09:01 UTC, the legitimate `explorer.exe` process (PID: 11028) was created.
2. At 15:57:18 UTC, a suspicious `svchost.exe` (SHA256: EAA94C9E35D2EE3C003A4F636D5B67DF9644BB97D54325CD43E93FE10CB95146) was created with PID 19140, spawned by the explorer.exe process.
3. The suspicious `svchost.exe` process created several files in the user's Temp directory, including DLLs typically associated with Python environments.
4. At 15:57:23 UTC, the suspicious `svchost.exe` process created a child process of itself (PID: 16964).
5. At 15:57:24 UTC, a `powershell.exe` process (PID: 17616) was created by the child `svchost.exe` process.
6. At 15:57:29 UTC, another `powershell.exe` process (PID: 18988) was created by the child `svchost.exe` process.
7. The suspicious `svchost.exe` process then deleted the files it had created in the Temp directory.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why

The problem process is the suspicious `svchost.exe` (SHA256: EAA94C9E35D2EE3C003A4F636D5B67DF9644BB97D54325CD43E93FE10CB95146, PID: 19140) located at `C:\Users\mcafee\Documents\svchost.exe`. This process is suspicious for several reasons:

1. It's not in the standard Windows system directory where legitimate svchost.exe files are typically located.
2. It was spawned by explorer.exe, which is unusual for a legitimate svchost process.
3. It created and then deleted files typically associated with Python environments.
4. It spawned multiple PowerShell processes, which could indicate malicious script execution.
5. The file has been classified as "malware.binary.exe;fe_ml_heuristic" by our tools.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. `svchost.exe` (PID: 19140, SHA256: EAA94C9E35D2EE3C003A4F636D5B67DF9644BB97D54325CD43E93FE10CB95146)
   - Located at `C:\Users\mcafee\Documents\svchost.exe`
   - Created by explorer.exe (PID: 11028)
   - Classified as potential malware

2. `svchost.exe` (PID: 16964)
   - Child process of the suspicious svchost.exe (PID: 19140)
   - Likely a copy or instance of the same malicious file

3. `powershell.exe` (PID: 17616, SHA256: C7D4E119149A7150B7101A4BD9FFFBF659FBA76D058F7BF6CC73C99FB36E8221)
   - Spawned by the suspicious svchost.exe (PID: 16964)
   - While PowerShell itself is legitimate, its execution in this context is suspicious

4. `powershell.exe` (PID: 18988, SHA256: C7D4E119149A7150B7101A4BD9FFFBF659FBA76D058F7BF6CC73C99FB36E8221)
   - Another instance spawned by the suspicious svchost.exe (PID: 16964)
   - Multiple PowerShell instances could indicate attempts to run malicious scripts

## 4. Key Points

1. The suspicious `svchost.exe` file is masquerading as a legitimate Windows process but is located in an unusual directory.
2. The process creates and then deletes files associated with Python environments, suggesting potential use of Python-based malware or scripts.
3. Multiple PowerShell instances are spawned, which could be used for executing malicious commands or scripts.
4. The suspicious process interacts with the Windows API, including calls to `ResumeThread` and `WriteProcessMemory`, which could indicate attempts to inject code or manipulate other processes.
5. The events occur within a short timeframe, suggesting an automated or scripted attack.

## 5. Insights

Based on the tool responses:

1. The suspicious `svchost.exe` (SHA256: EAA94C9E35D2EE3C003A4F636D5B67DF9644BB97D54325CD43E93FE10CB95146) has been classified as "malware.binary.exe;fe_ml_heuristic". It was first seen on 2024-10-16 (the same day as the incident), which suggests it's a relatively new threat.

2. The `explorer.exe` (SHA256: 4C1D9F1CB41545DD46430130FC3F0E15665BD1948942B0B85410305DAA7AAA9C) process is classified as "Most likely trusted" based on its digital signature. This is the legitimate Windows Explorer process.

3. The `powershell.exe` (SHA256: C7D4E119149A7150B7101A4BD9FFFBF659FBA76D058F7BF6CC73C99FB36E8221) is also classified as "Most likely trusted". However, its use in this context is suspicious.

4. Unfortunately, we couldn't retrieve additional details about campaigns, threats, lethality, prevalence, or determinism for these IOCs due to a timeout error and lack of records.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: DESKTOP-2HS9OV4
- OS: Windows 11 (Version 10.0.22000)
- IP Address: 10.54.13.101
- User: mcafee

## Recommendations

1. Immediately isolate the affected system (DESKTOP-2HS9OV4) to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus and anti-malware tools.
3. Investigate the source of the suspicious `svchost.exe` file in the user's Documents folder.
4. Analyze the PowerShell command history and any scripts that may have been executed.
5. Check for any unauthorized changes to the system, including new user accounts, scheduled tasks, or registry modifications.
6. Review network logs for any suspicious outbound connections that may indicate command and control (C2) communication.
7. Consider reimaging the system after thorough investigation and data preservation.
8. Update threat intelligence feeds with the IOCs found in this incident.
9. Conduct a broader search across the environment for similar IOCs or activity patterns.

This incident appears to be a significant security threat involving potential malware execution and suspicious PowerShell activity. Immediate action is required to contain and remediate the threat, as well as to prevent similar incidents in the future.
