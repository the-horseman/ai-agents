================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly! I'll analyze all the IOCs provided in the events using the available tools and then write a detailed report for a SOC analyst. Let's start by gathering information about all the IOCs.

Based on the information gathered from the tools, I'll now write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious Activity on Ubuntu 18.04 Server

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. On 2024-10-07 at 11:15:26 UTC, a series of processes were created on the Ubuntu 18.04 server (hostname: 7ZFUBU1804D01).
2. The initial process `httpd` (PID: 19861) was spawned by a parent process with PID 19851.
3. This `httpd` process then spawned multiple child processes, including another `httpd` instance (PID: 19862) and a `dash` shell (PID: 19864).
4. The `httpd` process (PID: 19862) then executed a `whoami` command (PID: 19863) and another `dash` shell.
5. The `dash` shell (PID: 19864) spawned by the initial `httpd` process executed two commands: another `dash` shell (PID: 19865) and the `date` command.
6. All processes were executed with root privileges.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The problem process appears to be the `httpd` binary located at `/home/appsadm/httpd` (SHA256: 29dc200050f712dbda0b1bd40cb946e5eceb073b7a3e0fb3f49849bdfacf6900). This process is suspicious for several reasons:

1. Non-standard location: Legitimate Apache httpd binaries are typically located in system directories, not in a user's home directory.
2. Permissions: The file has 0777 permissions, which is overly permissive and unusual for a server binary.
3. Behavior: It's spawning shell processes and executing commands like `whoami`, which is atypical for a web server process.
4. Execution as root: The process is running with root privileges, which is a security risk for a web server.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. `httpd` (PID: 19861, 19862, 19864)
   - Path: `/home/appsadm/httpd`
   - SHA256: 29dc200050f712dbda0b1bd40cb946e5eceb073b7a3e0fb3f49849bdfacf6900
   - Suspicious due to location and behavior

2. `whoami` (PID: 19863)
   - Path: `/usr/bin/whoami`
   - SHA256: 12ad4434de2701a3c007e5d1a35e116ee113d279cca06540dca5cd22d4a3c691
   - Suspicious in context, as web servers don't typically need to check user identity

3. `dash` (PID: 19865, 19863, 19864, 19862)
   - Path: `/bin/dash`
   - SHA256: 2fdc4546e1f425bcaf62624a7118fd4ba86c11e6277e8b9ee63263eb0dcbc6c5
   - Suspicious due to multiple instances spawned by the `httpd` process

4. `date` (PID: 19865)
   - Path: `/bin/date`
   - SHA256: 1f5e7c13d30a44a211f0cb86e9bf8ff75e7ccf04fed673437b3f86a8893f8bc6
   - Not inherently suspicious, but unusual in this context

## 4. Key Points

1. The `httpd` binary in the user's home directory is likely a malicious file masquerading as a web server.
2. All processes are running with root privileges, indicating a potential privilege escalation or compromise of the root account.
3. The execution of `whoami` and multiple shell instances suggests potential reconnaissance or attempt to maintain persistence.
4. The events are tagged with `@ATA.Discovery` and `@ATA.Persistence`, indicating possible malicious activity.
5. The detection has a severity of 's2' and a rank of 150, suggesting a moderate to high-risk event.

## 5. Insights

Based on the tool responses:

1. The `httpd` binary (SHA256: 29dc200050f712dbda0b1bd40cb946e5eceb073b7a3e0fb3f49849bdfacf6900) is not recognized as a known file, which further supports its suspicious nature.
2. The `whoami`, `dash`, and `date` binaries are classified as "Known trusted" with "vmware" as the classification name. This suggests these are legitimate system binaries, but their usage in this context is suspicious.
3. No specific campaign or threat information was found for any of the file hashes, indicating this could be a new or previously unclassified threat.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: 7ZFUBU1804D01
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
- IP Address: 10.26.45.150
- Last Boot Time: 2024-09-27T06:21:42Z

In conclusion, this event appears to be a genuine threat. The presence of a suspicious `httpd` binary in a non-standard location, executing with root privileges and spawning multiple shell processes, strongly suggests a compromised system. The SOC team should immediately isolate this host and conduct a thorough investigation, focusing on how the malicious binary was introduced and what other systems may have been affected.
