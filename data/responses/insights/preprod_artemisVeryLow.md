================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly! I'll analyze the events and use the provided tools to gather information about the IOCs. Then, I'll write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

First, let's gather information about the IOCs using the available tools.

Now that we have gathered the available information, let's create a detailed report for the SOC analyst.

# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious Process Execution

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. On 2024-08-26 at 12:55:32.782Z, a process named "Artemis-VeryLow-Troj.exe" (PID: 5432) was created on the host "479W10RS5X64" (IP: 10.26.23.232).
2. The process made several API calls in quick succession:
   - 12:55:32.817Z: GetWindowLong
   - 12:55:32.833Z: GetWindowInfo
   - 12:55:32.848Z: BitBlt
   - 12:55:32.848Z: NtGdiCreateCompatibleBitmap

3. The process was detected as potentially malicious at 12:56:58Z with a severity of s4 and a rank of 275.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The problem process is "Artemis-VeryLow-Troj.exe" (PID: 5432). This process is considered suspicious and potentially malicious for the following reasons:

1. Suspicious file name: The name "Artemis-VeryLow-Troj.exe" contains the word "Troj," which is often associated with Trojan malware.
2. Unusual file path: The file is located at "C:\Users\cdaauto\Desktop\Treatsample\Artemis-pwd-clean\Artemis\Artemis-VeryLow-Troj.exe", which is not a standard location for legitimate system files.
3. Detection tags: The process triggered detection tags including "@ATA.Execution", "@MSI._process_reputation_known_malicious", and "@MSI._process_suspicious_path".
4. API calls: The process made several API calls related to window manipulation and graphics, which could be indicative of screen capture or other malicious activities.
5. File classification: The file was classified as "fe_ml_heuristic;trojan.win32.ymacco.fec3;malware.generic.fec3;fe_heuristic_g2_537569", suggesting multiple detection engines identified it as potentially malicious.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

The main suspicious process is:

- Process Name: Artemis-VeryLow-Troj.exe
- Process ID (PID): 5432
- Parent Process ID: 5440
- User: cdaauto
- Path: C:\Users\cdaauto\Desktop\Treatsample\Artemis-pwd-clean\Artemis\Artemis-VeryLow-Troj.exe

No other suspicious processes were mentioned in the provided events.

## 4. Key Points

1. The suspicious file was executed from a user's desktop, specifically in a folder named "Treatsample".
2. The process made API calls related to window manipulation and graphics, which could indicate screen capture attempts.
3. The file has multiple malware classifications, including trojan and generic malware.
4. The event was detected with a severity of s4 (high) and a rank of 275, indicating a significant threat.
5. The file's creation date (2015-04-09) is much older than the execution date, which could indicate either an old malware sample or timestamp manipulation.

## 5. Insights

Based on the tool responses:

1. File Details:
   - MD5: F22F09A8C4C6CBAC02A4EC2C2DAE38CA
   - SHA1: E7B9F1268E46AFC6CD0143B98B097300CBA71CC6
   - SHA256: 9ED16B711776E1F4033D8B5E216B655A229A358131320033959BE6D07B7BED3D
   - File Size: 2835 bytes (reported as 1024 bytes in the event, possible discrepancy)
   - First Seen: 1712722544 (Unix timestamp, converts to 2024-04-10 10:55:44 UTC)
   - Classification: Unknown
   - Classification Name: fe_ml_heuristic;trojan.win32.ymacco.fec3;malware.generic.fec3;fe_heuristic_g2_537569

2. No specific campaign information was found for the identified IOCs.

3. The lack of additional information from the `get_details_on_indicators_of_compromise` tool suggests that these specific IOCs may not be widely known or associated with specific campaigns in the tool's database.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: 479W10RS5X64
- Operating System: Windows 10 (Build 17763)
- IP Address: 10.26.23.232
- MAC Address: 00:50:56:a4:0d:8c
- Last Boot Time: 2024-07-31T08:22:17Z

In conclusion, the execution of "Artemis-VeryLow-Troj.exe" on the specified host is highly suspicious and likely represents a security incident. The file's characteristics, detection tags, and API calls suggest malicious intent. Further investigation is required to determine the full extent of the potential compromise and any additional affected systems or users.
