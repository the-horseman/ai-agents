================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly! I'll ask relevant questions based on the report and then attempt to answer them using the available tools. Here are the questions I'd like to investigate further:

1. Were there any network connections made by Threat-Sample2.exe?
2. Did cmd.exe or regsvr32.exe make any suspicious network connections?
3. Are there any historical network activities associated with the IP address 10.0.149.78?
4. Was there any unusual user activity associated with the Administrator account during this time?
5. Are there any registry modifications made by the suspicious processes?
6. Were any scheduled tasks created or modified during this incident?

Now, let's try to answer these questions using the available tools.

# SOC Analyst Report: Investigation of Suspicious Activity on EC2AMAZ-HD7RBTO

## Questions and Answers

1. Were there any network connections made by Threat-Sample2.exe?
   - Answer: No network connections were found specifically for Threat-Sample2.exe. The historical network data query for this process returned no results.

2. Did cmd.exe or regsvr32.exe make any suspicious network connections?
   - Answer: Yes, regsvr32.exe made suspicious network connections. The historical network data shows multiple outbound connection attempts to 216.58.194.85 on port 9090, trying to access a file named "payload.sct". This is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malware activity.

3. Are there any historical network activities associated with the IP address 10.0.149.78?
   - Answer: The provided data does not show any specific network activities for 10.0.149.78. However, this IP is associated with the infected machine (EC2AMAZ-HD7RBTO).

4. Was there any unusual user activity associated with the Administrator account during this time?
   - Answer: The historical user data shows multiple login and logout events for the Administrator account, but none exactly at the time of the incident. The closest activity was a network login at 2024-10-03T10:29:57, about 3 hours before the incident. While not directly linked to the incident time, the frequent network logins could be a point of concern.

5. Are there any registry modifications made by the suspicious processes?
   - Answer: No registry modifications were found in the provided data. The query for historical registry data returned no results.

6. Were any scheduled tasks created or modified during this incident?
   - Answer: No scheduled tasks were found to be created or modified by Threat-Sample2.exe. The query for historical scheduled tasks data returned no results.

## Analysis and Insights

1. Threat-Sample2.exe Behavior:
   - While Threat-Sample2.exe didn't show direct network connections, it spawned other processes (cmd.exe and regsvr32.exe) which did exhibit suspicious network behavior.
   - The creation and deletion of python27.dll suggests potential use of Python-based malware or scripts.

2. Suspicious Network Activity:
   - The most concerning activity is from regsvr32.exe, which attempted to download a file named "payload.sct" from 216.58.194.85:9090.
   - This behavior is typical of malware using regsvr32 for execution and evasion (T1218.010 in MITRE ATT&CK).

3. User Activity:
   - While not directly linked to the incident time, the frequent network logins by the Administrator account could indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized access.

4. Lack of Registry and Scheduled Task Modifications:
   - The absence of registry modifications and new scheduled tasks might indicate that the malware was in an early stage or using alternative persistence mechanisms.

## Recommendations

1. Isolate the affected EC2 instance (EC2AMAZ-HD7RBTO) immediately to prevent further spread.
2. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the instance, focusing on Threat-Sample2.exe and any associated files.
3. Investigate the source of Threat-Sample2.exe and how it was introduced to the system.
4. Analyze the contents of the deleted python27.dll if possible.
5. Block outbound connections to 216.58.194.85 and investigate any successful connections to this IP.
6. Review and potentially reset Administrator account credentials.
7. Implement stricter network segmentation and monitoring for EC2 instances.
8. Enhance logging and monitoring for regsvr32.exe usage, especially when making network connections.
9. Conduct a broader review of all systems for similar indicators of compromise.

This incident appears to be a significant security breach involving potential malware execution and attempted command and control communication. Immediate action is required to mitigate the threat and prevent potential data exfiltration or further system compromise.
