================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly, I'll analyze the events and IOCs provided using the available tools, and then write a detailed report for a SOC analyst. Let's start by gathering information about the IOCs.

Based on the information gathered from the tools, I'll now write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

# SOC Analyst Report: Potential Code Injection and Information Stealer Activity

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. A suspicious executable `code-injection-sample.exe` (PID: 8252) was launched on the host `7ZFW10RS5X64` at 2024-09-24T13:18:04.308Z.
2. The suspicious process created several files in the temporary directory, including DLLs and a Python DLL.
3. The process performed a WriteProcessMemory API call to PID 7432, indicating potential code injection.
4. A new instance of `code-injection-sample.exe` (PID: 7432) was created as a child of the original process.
5. Two PowerShell instances (PIDs: 8196 and 8004) were spawned by the injected process.
6. The second PowerShell instance (PID: 8004) executed `whoami.exe` (PID: 876).
7. The original process (PID: 8252) deleted the temporary files it had created.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The problem process is `code-injection-sample.exe` (PID: 8252, SHA256: EAA94C9E35D2EE3C003A4F636D5B67DF9644BB97D54325CD43E93FE10CB95146). This process is suspicious for several reasons:

1. It has a name that suggests it's a code injection sample, which is inherently suspicious.
2. It creates and then deletes temporary files, including DLLs and a Python DLL, which could be an attempt to hide its activities.
3. It performs a WriteProcessMemory API call to another process (PID: 7432), indicating potential code injection.
4. It spawns multiple PowerShell instances, which could be used for further malicious activities.

## 4. Key Points

1. The main executable `code-injection-sample.exe` is classified as "malware.binary.exe;fe_ml_heuristic" by our tools.
2. Code injection technique is used to spawn a new process (PID: 7432).
3. Multiple PowerShell instances are launched, which could be used for further malicious activities.
4. The `whoami.exe` execution suggests the attacker is attempting to gather system information.
5. Temporary files are created and then deleted, possibly to evade detection.

## 5. Insights

1. The main executable (SHA256: EAA94C9E35D2EE3C003A4F636D5B67DF9644BB97D54325CD43E93FE10CB95146) is classified as unknown malware. No additional threat intelligence is available for this file.

2. PowerShell (SHA256: DE96A6E69944335375DC1AC238336066889D9FFC7D73628EF4FE1B1B160AB32C) is associated with a campaign named "Italy Targeted By Information Stealer Malware". Key details:
   - Lethality: 20 (Dual use)
   - Determinism: 20 (Non-deterministic)
   - The campaign uses phishing emails with an "Invoice" theme to deliver malicious LNK files.
   - The malware sets up persistence and collects crypto wallets, web browser data, and system information.
   - This PowerShell binary has been seen in multiple countries and sectors, with high prevalence in the Banking/Financial/Wealth Management sector.

3. The `whoami.exe` binary (SHA256: 1D5491E3C468EE4B4EF6EDFF4BBC7D06EE83180F6F0B1576763EA2EFE049493A) is classified as "Known trusted" and "ms-prerelease". No additional threat intelligence is available for this file.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: 7ZFW10RS5X64
- OS: Windows 10 (Build 17763)
- IP Address: 10.26.41.229
- MAC Address: 00:50:56:a4:fd:ff

## Recommendations

1. Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. Conduct a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus software.
3. Investigate the source of the `code-injection-sample.exe` file and how it was introduced to the system.
4. Review and analyze PowerShell logs for any suspicious activities or commands executed.
5. Check for any unauthorized changes to the system, including new scheduled tasks, registry modifications, or persistence mechanisms.
6. Investigate other systems on the network for similar indicators of compromise.
7. Update threat detection rules to include the identified IOCs, especially the SHA256 hash of the malicious executable.
8. Conduct a thorough investigation of the user "cdaauto" and their recent activities.
9. Consider implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging across the organization.

This incident appears to be a potentially serious threat involving code injection and possible information stealing capabilities. Immediate action is required to contain and eradicate the threat, as well as to prevent similar incidents in the future.
