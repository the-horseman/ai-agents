Certainly! I'll analyze the events, gather information about the IOCs using the provided tools, and then write a detailed report for a SOC analyst. Let's start by collecting information about the IOCs.

Now that we have gathered information about the IOCs, let's write a detailed report for the SOC analyst.

# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious Activity on DESKTOP-2HS9OV4

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. The initial process `wininit.exe` (PID: 768) was created at 2024-10-28T15:27:54.292Z.
2. `services.exe` (PID: 904) was spawned by `wininit.exe` at 2024-10-28T15:27:54.369Z.
3. `svchost.exe` (PID: 11284) was created by `services.exe` at 2024-10-28T15:29:23.811Z.
4. `cmd.exe` (PID: 9316) was spawned by `svchost.exe` at 2024-10-28T15:37:57.704Z.
5. A suspicious file `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe` (PID: 8252) was executed by `cmd.exe` at 2024-10-28T15:38:17.165Z.
6. `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe` spawned `lsassunhooker.exe` (PID: 12296) at 2024-10-28T15:38:17.316Z.
7. Multiple `cmd.exe` instances were created by `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe`.
8. Various system utilities were executed, including `msiexec.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `calc.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, `net.exe`, `systeminfo.exe`, `find.exe`, and `tasklist.exe`.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why

The problem process is `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe` (PID: 8252, SHA256: C9AE880B835B0428724921279C99978674C0C22EEA6AC3FA39BCDE53873A07D6). This process is suspicious for several reasons:

1. It was executed from an unusual location: `C:\Users\mcafee\Downloads\Nested-Child-Emulation-password-mitre\Nested-Child-Emulation.exe`.
2. It spawned multiple `cmd.exe` instances, which is atypical behavior for legitimate software.
3. It executed `lsassunhooker.exe`, which is likely attempting to interact with the LSASS process, a common target for credential theft.
4. The process performed various API calls, including `WriteProcessMemory` and `ResumeThread`, which could indicate attempts to inject code into other processes.
5. The file details for this process returned empty results, suggesting it might be a new or unknown file.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe` (PID: 8252)
   - Main suspicious process, as described above.

2. `lsassunhooker.exe` (PID: 12296)
   - Spawned by `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe`
   - Name suggests interaction with LSASS process
   - SHA256: 2D56615BEF295A3AE411EBDED1AB907729FC4868C07CA714EE55B768D89379AB
   - No file details available, indicating a potentially malicious or unknown file

3. Multiple `cmd.exe` instances (Various PIDs: 15904, 11620, 10292, 16328, 9388, 10032, 14624)
   - Spawned by `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe`
   - Used to execute various system utilities and commands

4. `rundll32.exe` (PID: 6424)
   - Spawned by one of the `cmd.exe` instances
   - Often used for legitimate purposes but can be abused for malicious activities

## 4. Key Points

1. The attack appears to have started with the execution of `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe` from the user's Downloads folder.
2. The malicious process attempted to interact with LSASS, potentially for credential theft.
3. Multiple command prompt instances were created, likely to execute various commands and utilities.
4. System reconnaissance tools were executed, including `whoami`, `netstat`, `systeminfo`, and `tasklist`.
5. The attacker attempted to create scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe`, which could be used for persistence.
6. Network-related commands were executed using `net.exe`, possibly to enumerate network resources or modify network settings.

## 5. Insights

1. Most of the executed system utilities are classified as "Known trusted" or "Most likely trusted" according to the file reputation data. This suggests that the attacker is leveraging legitimate Windows tools for malicious purposes, a technique known as "Living off the Land."

2. The `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe` and `lsassunhooker.exe` files returned no reputation data, indicating they are likely custom malware or newly compiled executables.

3. The sequence of events and the tools used suggest that this is a multi-stage attack, involving initial execution, credential theft attempts, system reconnaissance, and potential persistence mechanisms.

4. The use of `WriteProcessMemory` and `ResumeThread` API calls by the malicious process indicates possible attempts at process injection or manipulation.

5. The execution of `msiexec.exe` could be an attempt to bypass application whitelisting or to install additional malicious components.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: DESKTOP-2HS9OV4
- OS: Windows 11 (Build 22000)
- IP Address: 10.54.13.101
- MAC Address: 00:50:56:99:9b:c9

## Recommendations

1. Immediately isolate the affected system (DESKTOP-2HS9OV4) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full memory dump and disk image of the system for forensic analysis.
3. Investigate the source of the `Nested-Child-Emulation.exe` file and how it was introduced to the system.
4. Check for any scheduled tasks or persistence mechanisms that may have been created during the attack.
5. Review network logs for any suspicious outbound connections from the affected system.
6. Conduct a password reset for all accounts that may have been compromised, especially if LSASS manipulation was successful.
7. Perform a thorough scan of all systems in the network for similar IOCs.
8. Review and tighten security policies, especially those related to software installation and execution from user directories.

This incident appears to be a significant security breach involving custom malware and attempts at credential theft. Immediate action is required to contain and remediate the threat.
