Certainly! I'll analyze the events and use the provided tools to gather information about the IOCs. Then, I'll write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

First, let's gather information about the IOCs using the available tools.

Now, let's gather more details about the IOCs:

Now that we have gathered all the available information, let's create a detailed report for the SOC analyst.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The problem process is Threat-Sample2.exe (PID: 648), which is the initial process that triggers the suspicious activity chain. This process is considered problematic for the following reasons:

1. It has a suspicious file name ("Threat-Sample2.exe") located in a folder named "threatfiles".
2. It creates and later deletes a file named "python27.dll", which could be an attempt to hide its activities.
3. It spawns multiple child processes, including cmd.exe and regsvr32.exe, which are commonly used in malicious activities.
4. The file is classified as "unknown" with multiple malware-related classifications.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. Threat-Sample2.exe (PID: 648 and 5072)
   - Path: C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\threatfiles\threatfiles\Threat-Sample2.exe
   - SHA256: 211C2E02764A3B683948E08E44FB73B83FECDDAA6B567A40DBCB1AAEB6EE7DE1
   - Reason: Unknown classification, multiple malware-related classifications

2. cmd.exe (PID: 6648 and 2440)
   - Path: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
   - SHA256: BC866CFCDDA37E24DC2634DC282C7A0E6F55209DA17A8FA105B07414C0E7C527
   - Reason: While cmd.exe is a legitimate Windows tool, its usage in this context is suspicious due to being spawned by the potentially malicious Threat-Sample2.exe

3. regsvr32.exe (PID: 6032)
   - Path: C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe
   - SHA256: F098FA150D9199732B4EC2E81528A951503A30F75AFEBF7E7A48360301758C67
   - Reason: Although regsvr32.exe is a legitimate Windows tool, it's often misused for malicious purposes, especially when spawned by suspicious processes

## 4. Key Points

1. The initial execution of Threat-Sample2.exe triggers a chain of suspicious activities.
2. The creation and subsequent deletion of python27.dll suggest potential malicious behavior or an attempt to hide activities.
3. The use of cmd.exe and regsvr32.exe in this context is suspicious and may indicate attempts at command execution and registry manipulation.
4. All activities are performed under the Administrator account, indicating a potential compromise of high-privilege credentials.
5. The events occur on a Windows 2019 server (EC2AMAZ-HD7RBTO), which could be an AWS EC2 instance.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: EC2AMAZ-HD7RBTO
- OS: Windows 2019 (Version 10.0.17763)
- IP Address: 10.0.149.78
- MAC Address: 02:a6:10:a0:7e:2d
- Last Boot Time: 2024-08-06T13:49:50Z

In conclusion, this series of events appears to be a significant threat. The execution of a suspicious file (Threat-Sample2.exe) with multiple malware-related classifications, followed by the creation of potentially malicious DLLs and the use of command-line tools, strongly suggests malicious activity. Immediate investigation and remediation steps should be taken to address this threat on the EC2 instance.
