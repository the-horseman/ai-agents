================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly! I'll analyze all the IOCs provided in the events using the available tools and then write a detailed report for a SOC analyst. Let's start by gathering information about all the IOCs.

Now, let's gather more details about the IOCs:

Now that we have gathered all the available information, let's create a detailed report for the SOC analyst.

# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious Activity on Ubuntu Server

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. On 2024-10-07 at 11:15:26 UTC, a series of processes were created on the Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS server named '7ZFUBU1804D01'.
2. The initial process `httpd` (PID: 19861) was created, which then spawned multiple child processes.
3. Several instances of `dash` shell were executed, along with `whoami` and `date` commands.
4. All processes were running with root privileges.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The problem process appears to be `httpd` (SHA256: 29dc200050f712dbda0b1bd40cb946e5eceb073b7a3e0fb3f49849bdfacf6900) for the following reasons:

1. Unusual location: The `httpd` process is running from `/home/appsadm/httpd`, which is not a standard location for the Apache web server binary.
2. Permissions: The file has 0777 permissions, which is overly permissive and suspicious for a system binary.
3. Spawning behavior: This process is spawning multiple child processes, including shells and system information commands.
4. Root privileges: The process is running with root privileges, which is unnecessary for a web server under normal circumstances.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. `httpd` (PID: 19861, 19862, 19864)
   - Path: `/home/appsadm/httpd`
   - SHA256: 29dc200050f712dbda0b1bd40cb946e5eceb073b7a3e0fb3f49849bdfacf6900
   - Permissions: 0777
   - User: root

2. `dash` (PID: 19865, 19863, 19864, 19862)
   - Path: `/bin/dash`
   - SHA256: 2fdc4546e1f425bcaf62624a7118fd4ba86c11e6277e8b9ee63263eb0dcbc6c5
   - User: root

3. `whoami` (PID: 19863)
   - Path: `/usr/bin/whoami`
   - SHA256: 12ad4434de2701a3c007e5d1a35e116ee113d279cca06540dca5cd22d4a3c691
   - User: root

4. `date` (PID: 19865)
   - Path: `/bin/date`
   - SHA256: 1f5e7c13d30a44a211f0cb86e9bf8ff75e7ccf04fed673437b3f86a8893f8bc6
   - User: root

## 4. Key Points

1. The `httpd` process is likely a malicious binary masquerading as a web server.
2. All processes are running with root privileges, indicating a potential system compromise.
3. The execution of `whoami` and `date` commands suggests reconnaissance activity.
4. Multiple instances of the `dash` shell were spawned, which could indicate attempts at persistence or further system exploration.
5. The events were first detected on 2024-10-07 at 11:17:07 UTC, with a severity rating of s2 and a rank of 150.

## 5. Insights

1. File details for `httpd` (29dc200050f712dbda0b1bd40cb946e5eceb073b7a3e0fb3f49849bdfacf6900) were not found in the threat intelligence database, suggesting it might be a new or custom malware.
2. The `whoami` binary (12ad4434de2701a3c007e5d1a35e116ee113d279cca06540dca5cd22d4a3c691) is classified as "Known trusted" by VMware, with a file size of 30,904 bytes.
3. The `dash` shell (2fdc4546e1f425bcaf62624a7118fd4ba86c11e6277e8b9ee63263eb0dcbc6c5) is also classified as "Known trusted" by VMware, with a file size of 121,432 bytes.
4. The `date` binary (1f5e7c13d30a44a211f0cb86e9bf8ff75e7ccf04fed673437b3f86a8893f8bc6) is classified as "Known trusted" by VMware, with a file size of 100,568 bytes.
5. No specific campaign information was found for any of the IOCs.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: 7ZFUBU1804D01
- OS: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (Bionic Beaver)
- IP Address: 10.26.45.150
- MAC Address: 00:50:56:a4:25:3e
- Last Boot Time: 2024-09-27T06:21:42Z

In conclusion, this incident appears to be a potential web shell attack or unauthorized access to the Ubuntu server. The presence of a suspicious `httpd` binary in an unusual location, running with root privileges and spawning multiple processes, strongly indicates a security breach. Immediate investigation and containment actions are recommended.
