# Final Report: Analysis of code-injection-sample.exe Threat

## 1. What is the initial infection vector for the `code-injection-sample.exe` file?

**Answer:** Based on the available information, we cannot definitively determine the initial infection vector for the `code-injection-sample.exe` file. The file was executed from `C:\Users\cdaauto\Desktop\code-injection-sample.exe`, suggesting it may have been downloaded or placed on the desktop by the user or another process. However, without additional context or historical data, we cannot confirm how it arrived on the system.

**Thought process:** Understanding the initial infection vector is crucial for preventing future infections and identifying potential vulnerabilities in the system or user behavior.

## 2. Are there any historical instances of this file being executed on other devices in the network?

**Answer:** Based on the results from the `get_historical_file_data` and `get_historical_process_data` queries, we found no historical instances of this file being executed on other devices in the network. This suggests that the infection might be limited to this single device, but further investigation across the network is recommended.

**Thought process:** Identifying the spread of the malware helps in determining the scope of the incident and prioritizing remediation efforts.

## 3. What is the significance of the PowerShell instances being spawned by the injected process?

**Answer:** The malware spawns two PowerShell instances (PIDs 8196 and 8004) from the injected process (PID 7432). This is significant because PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool that can be used for various malicious activities, including data exfiltration, further payload downloads, or system manipulation. The use of PowerShell suggests that the malware is attempting to perform additional actions on the system.

**Thought process:** PowerShell is often used by attackers for its versatility and ability to interact with the Windows operating system, making it important to analyze its usage in potential threats.

## 4. Is there any network activity associated with this malware?

**Answer:** Based on the `get_historical_network_data` query, we found no evidence of network activity directly associated with the `code-injection-sample.exe` process. However, this doesn't rule out the possibility of network activity, as the malware might use PowerShell or other processes for communication.

**Thought process:** Network activity can indicate command and control communication or data exfiltration attempts, which are crucial for understanding the full scope of the threat.

## 5. Are there any registry modifications or scheduled tasks created by this malware?

**Answer:** The `get_historical_registry_data` and `get_historical_scheduled_tasks_data` queries returned no results, suggesting that no registry modifications or scheduled tasks were detected in association with this malware. However, this doesn't definitively rule out such activities, as they might have been performed in a way that evaded detection.

**Thought process:** Registry modifications and scheduled tasks are common persistence mechanisms used by malware, so checking for these activities is important for understanding the malware's capabilities and impact.

## 6. What is the purpose of the `whoami.exe` execution?

**Answer:** The execution of `whoami.exe` (PID 876) by one of the PowerShell instances suggests that the malware is attempting to gather information about the current user context. This could be part of a reconnaissance phase, where the malware is collecting system and user information to determine its next actions or to prepare for privilege escalation attempts.

**Thought process:** Understanding the purpose of specific commands executed by malware helps in determining its intentions and potential impact on the system.

## 7. Are there any other users affected by this malware besides "cdaauto"?

**Answer:** Based on the available information and the `get_historical_user_data` query, we don't have evidence of other users being affected by this malware. All observed activities are associated with the "cdaauto" user account. However, a broader investigation across the network and other user accounts is recommended to ensure the malware hasn't spread or affected other users.

**Thought process:** Identifying all affected users is crucial for containing the threat and ensuring comprehensive remediation across the organization.

## Conclusion

The `code-injection-sample.exe` malware demonstrates sophisticated behavior, including code injection techniques and the use of PowerShell for potential further exploitation. While we don't have evidence of widespread infection or significant system changes, the malware's capabilities suggest it could be part of a more extensive attack. Immediate containment, thorough investigation of the affected system, and network-wide scanning for similar indicators of compromise are recommended. Additionally, reviewing and strengthening security measures, especially around PowerShell usage and execution policies, should be considered to prevent similar incidents in the future.

    "What is the initial infection vector for the `code-injection-sample.exe` file?": "Based on the available information, we cannot definitively determine the initial infection vector for the `code-injection-sample.exe` file. The file was executed from C:\\Users\\cdaauto\\Desktop\\code-injection-sample.exe, suggesting it may have been downloaded or placed on the desktop by the user or another process. However, without additional context or historical data, we cannot confirm how it arrived on the system."
}
</answer>Certainly! I'll use the available tools to investigate the specific actions performed by the PowerShell instances spawned by the malware. Let's start by querying for historical process data related to these PowerShell instances.

Unfortunately, the query didn't return any results. Let's try to get more information about the PowerShell processes using their process IDs:

It seems that we don't have detailed historical data about the specific actions performed by these PowerShell instances. However, we can analyze the information available in the original event data to draw some conclusions.

{
    "What specific actions were performed by the PowerShell instances spawned by the malware?": "Based on the available information, we can't determine the exact commands or scripts executed by the PowerShell instances. However, we can infer some actions:

    1. Two PowerShell instances were spawned by the injected process (PID 7432):
       - First instance: PID 8196, created at 2024-09-24T13:18:04.621Z
       - Second instance: PID 8004, created at 2024-09-24T13:18:07.111Z

    2. The second PowerShell instance (PID 8004) executed 'whoami.exe' (PID 876) at 2024-09-24T13:18:08.046Z. This suggests that at least one of the PowerShell instances was used to gather information about the current user context.

    3. No network activity, registry modifications, or scheduled tasks were directly associated with these PowerShell instances based on our queries.

    4. The lack of additional information about these PowerShell instances could indicate that they were used for in-memory operations or that their actions were not fully captured by the logging system.

    5. The use of multiple PowerShell instances suggests that the malware might be performing different tasks with each instance, possibly to evade detection or to parallelize its activities.

    While we can't determine the full extent of actions performed by these PowerShell instances, their presence and the execution of 'whoami.exe' indicate that the malware was likely performing reconnaissance and potentially preparing for further malicious activities on the system."
}
</answer>Certainly! To investigate potential data exfiltration attempts by the malware or its spawned processes, we'll need to look at network activities and file operations. Let's use our available tools to gather this information.

First, let's check for any network activities associated with the malware and its spawned processes:

It seems we encountered a timeout error. Let's try again with a more specific query:

Now, let's check for any suspicious file operations that might indicate data gathering or staging for exfiltration:

Based on these results and the information from the original event data, we can now answer the question:

<answer>
{
    "Are there any signs of data exfiltration attempts by the malware or its spawned processes?": "Based on the available information and the results of our queries, we have not found direct evidence of data exfiltration attempts by the malware or its spawned processes. However, this doesn't conclusively rule out the possibility of data exfiltration. Here's a summary of our findings:

    1. Network Activity: Our queries for historical network data associated with 'code-injection-sample.exe' and its spawned PowerShell processes returned no results. This suggests that no obvious network connections were made by these processes within the timeframe and scope of our data.

    2. File Operations: We found no evidence of suspicious file operations that might indicate data gathering or staging for exfiltration. The original event data showed file creation and deletion activities, but these were related to the malware's execution environment (temporary files in the _MEI82522 directory) rather than user data.

    3. Limited Visibility: It's important to note that the lack of evidence doesn't necessarily mean no exfiltration occurred. The malware could be using techniques that evade detection or operate outside the scope of our current logging and monitoring capabilities.

    4. Reconnaissance Activity: While we didn't see direct exfiltration attempts, the execution of 'whoami.exe' by one of the PowerShell instances suggests that the malware was gathering system information. This could be a precursor to data exfiltration or other malicious activities.

    5. Potential In-Memory Operations: The use of code injection and PowerShell could indicate that the malware is capable of performing operations entirely in memory, which might not leave traces in our current logs.

    Given these observations, while we haven't found direct evidence of data exfiltration, the behavior of the malware is consistent with the early stages of an attack that could lead to data exfiltration. It's possible that the malware was interrupted before it could proceed to data gathering and exfiltration phases, or that these activities were performed in a way that wasn't captured by our current monitoring.

    Recommendations:
    1. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the affected system.
    2. Enhance network monitoring to capture and analyze all outbound connections, especially from PowerShell processes.
    3. Implement or improve Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions to detect potential exfiltration attempts.
    4. Review and strengthen PowerShell logging and execution policies across the organization."
