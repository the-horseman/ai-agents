================================== Ai Message ==================================

Certainly! I'll analyze the events, query the IOCs using the provided tools, and then write a detailed report for a SOC analyst. Let's start by gathering information about the IOCs.

Based on the information gathered from the events and the tool responses, I'll now write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious Activity on DESKTOP-2HS9OV4

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. On 2024-10-21 at 13:10:51 UTC, the `explorer.exe` process (PID: 11044) was created by the user "mcafee".
2. At 13:14:07 UTC, `Threat-Sample2.exe` (PID: 3756) was executed from the user's desktop, spawned by `explorer.exe`.
3. `Threat-Sample2.exe` loaded `ws2_32.dll`, created temporary files, and then spawned another instance of itself (PID: 12428).
4. The second instance of `Threat-Sample2.exe` then created a `cmd.exe` process (PID: 12440).
5. This `cmd.exe` process spawned another `cmd.exe` (PID: 11444).
6. Finally, `regsvr32.exe` (PID: 10312) was executed by the second `cmd.exe` process.
7. The original `Threat-Sample2.exe` process deleted temporary files after execution.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The problem process is `Threat-Sample2.exe` (SHA256: 211C2E02764A3B683948E08E44FB73B83FECDDAA6B567A40DBCB1AAEB6EE7DE1). This process is suspicious for several reasons:

1. It's located in a folder named "ThreatSamples", suggesting it's a known malicious file.
2. It spawns multiple processes, including cmd.exe and regsvr32.exe, which are commonly used in malicious activities.
3. It creates and deletes temporary files, possibly to avoid detection.
4. The file details from our tools indicate it's classified as "unknown" with heuristic detections for malware.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. `Threat-Sample2.exe` (PID: 3756 and 12428)
   - Spawned multiple processes
   - Created and deleted temporary files
   - Classified as potentially malicious

2. `cmd.exe` (PID: 12440 and 11444)
   - Spawned by the suspicious `Threat-Sample2.exe`
   - Used to execute further commands

3. `regsvr32.exe` (PID: 10312)
   - Spawned by `cmd.exe`
   - Often used legitimately but also abused for malicious purposes (Living off the Land Binary)

## 4. Key Points

1. The initial execution of `Threat-Sample2.exe` was from the user's desktop, suggesting possible user interaction or a compromised account.
2. The use of `regsvr32.exe` could indicate an attempt to bypass security controls or load malicious DLLs.
3. The creation and deletion of temporary files may be an attempt to evade detection or clean up after the malicious activity.
4. The multiple layers of process creation (Threat-Sample2 -> cmd -> cmd -> regsvr32) could be an attempt to obfuscate the attack chain.

## 5. Insights

- The file `Threat-Sample2.exe` (SHA256: 211C2E02764A3B683948E08E44FB73B83FECDDAA6B567A40DBCB1AAEB6EE7DE1) is classified as "unknown" with heuristic detections for malware. It was first seen on 2024-10-16, which is relatively recent.
- Other processes involved (`explorer.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `regsvr32.exe`) are legitimate Windows executables, but their usage in this context is suspicious.
- The `regsvr32.exe` file (SHA256: 73211CDB4C7756FF0E9F33F8F377D6AC2E863DD02208D7E7D7B9EB03FE76623B) is classified as "Known trusted", which is expected for a Windows system file.
- Unfortunately, we couldn't retrieve additional details about campaigns, threats, lethality, prevalence, or determinism for the IOCs due to API timeouts or lack of data.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: DESKTOP-2HS9OV4
- OS: Windows 11 (Build 22000)
- IP Address: 10.54.13.101
- User: mcafee

## Recommendations

1. Isolate the affected system (DESKTOP-2HS9OV4) to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. Conduct a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus software.
3. Investigate the source of `Threat-Sample2.exe` and how it was introduced to the system.
4. Check for any persistence mechanisms that may have been established.
5. Review and analyze network logs for any suspicious outbound connections.
6. Investigate the user account "mcafee" for potential compromise.
7. Consider reimaging the system after thorough investigation and data preservation.
8. Update security awareness training for users, emphasizing the dangers of executing unknown files.

This incident appears to be a genuine security threat and requires immediate attention and thorough investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise and prevent further damage.
