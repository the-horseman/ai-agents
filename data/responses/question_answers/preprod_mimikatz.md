# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious PowerShell Activity

## Questions and Answers

1. **What is the exact content of the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script?**
   - Unfortunately, we couldn't retrieve the exact content of the script. However, we know it's located at `C:\Users\cdaauto\Desktop\threatfiles\threatfiles\AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1` and has a SHA256 hash of 67F3D0692277A433D1524E5BEA36753C5DF00B7F4FD001FD92C2C4EAB86049B3.
   - The script was read by the PowerShell process, indicating it was likely executed.

   *Thought process: Understanding the content of the script is crucial to determine its purpose and potential malicious activities.*

2. **Are there any historical executions of this PowerShell script on the system?**
   - We couldn't retrieve historical data due to tool limitations. However, the current execution is cause for concern.

   *Thought process: Multiple executions could indicate persistent malicious activity.*

3. **What are the specific registry modifications made by the PowerShell process?**
   - The process modified the following registry keys:
     - HKCU\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS NT\CURRENTVERSION\IMAGE FILE EXECUTION OPTIONS
     - HKLM\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WINDOWS NT\CURRENTVERSION\IMAGE FILE EXECUTION OPTIONS
   - Both keys had their "DEBUGGER" and "BREAKONDLLLOAD" values changed from 288705 to 918777.

   *Thought process: Registry modifications, especially in Image File Execution Options, can be used for persistence or to interfere with other processes.*

4. **What network connections were established by the PowerShell process?**
   - Outbound connections were made to:
     - IP: 10.194.0.190
     - Port: 9090
     - DNS Names: proxy.ess.gslb.entsec.com, us-lvs-essmwg1.corp.entsec.com

   *Thought process: Network connections could indicate command and control activity or data exfiltration.*

5. **Why did the PowerShell process create and execute the whoami.exe process?**
   - The whoami.exe process was created with PID 4928.
   - This is likely an attempt to gather information about the current user context.

   *Thought process: Executing whoami is often part of reconnaissance activities in an attack chain.*

6. **Are there any signs of credential dumping or access to sensitive processes like LSASS?**
   - Yes, the PowerShell process accessed the LSASS process, which is a critical Windows component responsible for authentication.
   - This access is highly suspicious and often associated with credential dumping techniques.

   *Thought process: Access to LSASS is a red flag for potential credential theft.*

## Conclusion

The observed PowerShell activity exhibits several characteristics of a potential attack:

1. Execution of a suspicious script (AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1)
2. Registry modifications that could be used for persistence
3. Network connections to potentially malicious endpoints
4. Reconnaissance activities (whoami execution)
5. Access to sensitive processes (LSASS)

These activities collectively suggest a possible multi-stage attack involving reconnaissance, execution of malicious code, potential credential theft, and possible command and control communication. Immediate investigation and containment measures are recommended, including:

- Isolating the affected system
- Analyzing the content of the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script
- Investigating the purpose of the network connections
- Checking for any compromised credentials
- Reviewing and reverting the registry changes
- Conducting a thorough scan of the system for additional indicators of compromise

</answer>I apologize for the oversight. You're right, I should focus on answering the specific lead provided. Let's use the appropriate tool to try and retrieve the content of the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script.

<answer>
{
    "What is the exact content of the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script?": "Unfortunately, I was unable to retrieve the exact content of the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script using the provided tool. The get_historical_file_data function returned an empty result, which suggests that either the file content is not available in the historical data or the file has been deleted or modified since the detection time. 

However, based on the information available in the event logs, we know the following about the script:

1. File name: AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1
2. File path: C:\\Users\\cdaauto\\Desktop\\threatfiles\\threatfiles\\AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1
3. SHA256 hash: 67F3D0692277A433D1524E5BEA36753C5DF00B7F4FD001FD92C2C4EAB86049B3
4. File size: 1363 bytes
5. Creation date: 2022-05-11T18:51:56.000Z
6. Last modification date: 2022-05-11T18:51:56.000Z
7. MD5 hash: 0581DE6B7F79A9656788B027BBC6D3C1
8. SHA1 hash: C461A83B637842A9F6E9FEBF8A870D39C4C1C55A

While we don't have the exact content, the script's execution led to suspicious activities such as registry modifications, network connections, and access to sensitive processes like LSASS. This suggests that the script likely contained malicious code designed to perform these actions.

To determine the exact content and purpose of the script, it would be necessary to locate and analyze the file directly on the affected system or from a backup if available."
}
</answer>Certainly, I'll use the available tools to investigate any additional files or processes that might have been created or modified by the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script. Let's start by looking for historical process data around the time the script was executed.

It seems we didn't get any results for child processes. Let's try to look for any file modifications that occurred around the same time:



Unfortunately, we're not getting any additional information from the historical data tools. Let's analyze the information we have from the original event logs to answer the question.

<answer>
{
    "Can we find any additional files or processes created or modified by the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script?": "Based on the available information from the event logs, we can identify several files and processes that were created or modified during the execution of the PowerShell process that ran the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script:

1. Files created and deleted:
   - C:\\Users\\cdaauto\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_ihz5xlpc.x2h.ps1
   - C:\\Users\\cdaauto\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\__PSScriptPolicyTest_3e3o4rmy.jo5.psm1
   These temporary files were likely created as part of the script's execution and then deleted to cover its tracks.

2. File modified:
   - C:\\Users\\cdaauto\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt
   This file stores PowerShell command history, suggesting that the script execution was logged in the PowerShell history.

3. Process created:
   - C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe (PID: 4928)
   This process was directly created by the PowerShell script, likely to gather information about the current user context.

4. Registry modifications:
   While not files or processes, the script made significant changes to the registry, specifically to the Image File Execution Options keys in both HKCU and HKLM hives.

5. Potential access to sensitive processes:
   The script appeared to access the LSASS process, which could indicate an attempt at credential dumping.

While we couldn't retrieve additional historical data using the provided tools, the event logs show that the AboveThreshold_G9wWZ.ps1 script's execution led to the creation of temporary files, modification of PowerShell history, creation of a new process, and significant registry changes. These activities suggest a multi-faceted approach, potentially involving reconnaissance, persistence mechanisms, and possible credential access attempts."

</answer>Certainly, I'll use the available tools to check the current status of the network connections, particularly focusing on the connection to 10.194.0.190:9090 and the associated domains (proxy.ess.gslb.entsec.com and us-lvs-essmwg1.corp.entsec.com). Let's use the get_current_network_data tool to retrieve this information.

<answer>
{
    "What is the current status of the network connections established during the script execution? Are there any active connections to 10.194.0.190:9090 or the associated domains?": "Unfortunately, I am unable to provide current information about the network connections because the device (479W1022H264) is currently offline. As a result, no real-time data could be retrieved.

Based on the historical event logs, we know that during the script execution, the following network connections were established:

1. Destination IP: 10.194.0.190
2. Destination Port: 9090
3. Associated domains: proxy.ess.gslb.entsec.com and us-lvs-essmwg1.corp.entsec.com

However, since the device is offline, we cannot determine if these connections are still active or if there are any new connections to these IP addresses or domains.

For a comprehensive analysis of the current network status, it would be necessary to wait until the device comes back online. Once online, we could then use the get_current_network_data tool to check for any active connections to the suspicious IP and domains.

In the meantime, it's recommended to:

1. Investigate why the device is offline. This could be due to normal operations, or it might be a result of the suspicious activity.
2. Prepare to perform a thorough network analysis once the device comes back online.
3. Consider checking other devices on the network for similar connections to 10.194.0.190:9090 or the associated domains, as the threat might have spread beyond this single device.
4. Review firewall and network logs, if available, for any ongoing connections to these IP addresses and domains from other devices in the network.

Given the device's offline status, we should focus on analyzing the historical data and preparing for a comprehensive investigation once the device becomes accessible again."
