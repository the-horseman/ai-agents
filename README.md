# Lightweight Investigations

This system can produce and consume events from a Kafka Broker. 
Once we have the events, we use the different set of tool availbale to our AI system to analyze the events and understand what is happening. 
We are using the immense Knowledge that is available in LLM models to analyse them. 
Here we have actuallly automated the work of an entire team that is supposed to traige the events and send the report to a senior who makes a decision for next steps. 

This being just a small hackathon project, This does not yet include the neo4J but we are directly using APIs to talk to the cebtral DB. 
Using neo4J should actually imporve the performance for the system as well as save the query costs. 
This is POC. Which was later accepted by the company for a complete project. 
This is the reason why the internal APIs do not have credentials. 

Thanks and Rgeards.
