Certainly! I'll analyze the events and use the provided tools to gather information about the IOCs. Then, I'll write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

First, let's gather information about the IOCs using the available tools.

Now, let's gather information about the IOCs using the get_details_on_indicators_of_compromise tool.

Now that we have gathered the available information, I'll write a detailed report for a SOC analyst in markdown format.

# SOC Analyst Report: Suspicious Activity on MacOS Host

## 1. Complete Flow of Events

1. 2024-10-07T09:29:13.445Z: Initial system boot with `launchd` (PID 1) starting.
2. 2024-10-07T09:55:59.000Z: SSH daemon (`sshd`) processes created (PIDs 786 and 790).
3. 2024-10-07T09:55:59.000Z: User `interop` logs in via SSH, starting a `zsh` shell (PID 792).
4. 2024-10-07T09:56:04.000Z: `sudo` command executed (PID 809) by user `interop`.
5. 2024-10-07T09:56:10.000Z: User switches to root using `su` (PID 810), spawning a `bash` shell (PID 811).
6. 2024-10-07T09:57:08.000Z: First `osascript` execution (PID 812) by root.
7. 2024-10-07T09:57:54.000Z: Another `bash` shell spawned (PID 818) by root.
8. 2024-10-07T09:59:43.000Z: Second `osascript` execution (PID 827) by root.
9. 2024-10-07T10:00:21.000Z: Third `osascript` execution (PID 831) by root.

## 2. The Problem Process and Why?

The problem process appears to be `osascript` (PID 812, 827, and 831) executed by the root user. This is concerning for several reasons:

1. `osascript` is used to run AppleScript, which can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.
2. It's being executed with root privileges, which gives it extensive access to the system.
3. It's executed multiple times in a short period, which could indicate automated or scripted behavior.
4. The execution of `osascript` is tagged with severity levels s4 (highest) and unknown, suggesting potential malicious activity.

## 3. Suspicious Processes

1. `sudo` (PID 809): Used to gain elevated privileges.
2. `su` (PID 810): Used to switch to the root user.
3. `osascript` (PIDs 812, 827, 831): Multiple executions with root privileges.
4. `bash` (PIDs 811, 818, 831): Multiple bash shells spawned, potentially used for command execution.

## 4. Key Points

1. The attack appears to have started with an SSH login by user `interop`.
2. The attacker quickly escalated privileges to root using `sudo` and `su`.
3. Multiple `osascript` executions suggest potential attempts to run malicious AppleScript code.
4. The events span from 09:55:59 to 10:00:21, indicating a relatively quick attack progression.
5. The host OS is MacOS Ventura (version 13.1).

## 5. Insights

Unfortunately, the tools provided did not return any additional information about the file hashes or IOCs. This limits our ability to determine if these processes are part of known malware campaigns or their specific threat levels. However, the behavior observed is highly suspicious and warrants immediate investigation.

## 6. Device Details

- Hostname: 7ZFMAC1301
- OS: MacOS Ventura (version 13.1)
- IP Address: 10.26.41.205
- MAC Address: 00:50:56:a4:7e:67

## Recommendations

1. Immediately isolate the affected host (7ZFMAC1301) to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. Investigate the contents and actions of the AppleScripts executed by `osascript`.
3. Review SSH logs to understand how the `interop` user gained access.
4. Check for any data exfiltration or additional malware dropped on the system.
5. Investigate the `interop` user account and how it obtained sudo privileges.
6. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected host.
7. Review and tighten SSH access policies and sudo permissions across the environment.
8. Implement additional monitoring for `osascript` executions, especially those run with elevated privileges.

This incident should be treated as a potential breach, and a full incident response process should be initiated immediately.
